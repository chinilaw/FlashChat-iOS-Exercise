# FlashChat-iOS-Exercise
An exercise I learned in Udemy that is basically a chat app but with the use of Firebase.

What I Learned
- Incorporating Firebase in Xcode
- Using realtime database from Firebase to store the chat messages
- Authentication API provided by Firebase to allow register and login functionalities
- Creation of Custom Cells
- Using Chameleon framework to incorporate colors for the chat bubbles
- Removing separator from table view
- Using SVProgressHUD to indicate loading
